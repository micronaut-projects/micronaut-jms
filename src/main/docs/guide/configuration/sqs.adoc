= Configuring Amazon SQS

To use Amazon SQS, add the following property to your `application.yml`

[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  jms:
    sqs:
      enabled: true
----

and the following to your `build.gradle` or `pom.xml`

dependency:io.micronaut.jms:micronaut-jms-sqs[]


See the link:https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide/index.html[Micronaut AWS] docs for more information.

Note that it's not necessary to add a dependency on `io.micronaut.aws:micronaut-aws-sdk-v2` as it's already a transitive dependency of `io.micronaut.jms:micronaut-jms-sqs`.

The JMS link:{apijms}ConnectionFactory.html[ConnectionFactory] will be an instance of `com.amazon.sqs.javamessaging.SQSConnectionFactory`; you can customize that with a link:{apimicronaut}context/event/BeanCreatedEventListener.html[BeanCreatedEventListener].

TIP: See the guide for https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-jms-aws-sqs.html[Connect a Micronaut JMS Application to an AWS SQS Queue] to learn more.
