= Configuring Unsupported Brokers

Using an unsupported JMS broker is simple; you simply need to instantiate a `ConnectionFactory` like the following:

[source,java]
----
import io.micronaut.context.annotation.Factory;
import io.micronaut.jms.annotations.JMSConnectionFactory;
import javax.jms.ConnectionFactory;

@Factory
public class MyJMSConfig {
    @JMSConnectionFactory("myConnectionFactory")
    public ConnectionFactory connectionFactory() {
        return new ...;
    }
}
----

With this in place you can configure consumers and producers that use the connection factory by referencing the bean name (`"myConnectionFactory"` in the example) in `@JMSProducer` and `@JMSListener` annotations on your producer interfaces and consumer classes.
