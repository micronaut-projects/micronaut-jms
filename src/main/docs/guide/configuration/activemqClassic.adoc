= Configuring ActiveMQ "Classic"

To use ActiveMQ "Classic", add the following properties to your `application.yml`

[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  jms:
    activemq:
      classic:
        enabled: true
        connection-string: 'tcp://host:port'
----

and the following to your `build.gradle` or `pom.xml`

dependency:io.micronaut.jms:micronaut-jms-activemq-classic[]

The JMS link:{apijms}ConnectionFactory.html[ConnectionFactory] will be an instance of link:{apiActiveMqClassic}ActiveMQConnectionFactory.html[ActiveMQConnectionFactory]. Only the broker URL is configurable in `application.yml` but further customization is possible with a link:{apimicronaut}context/event/BeanCreatedEventListener.html[BeanCreatedEventListener].
